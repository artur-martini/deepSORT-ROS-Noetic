# DeepSORT object tracker with YOLO-v4, TensorRT and ROS Noetic

The main goal off this project is to integrate a Deep Learning framework with the robotics middleware ROS. The main tasks are:

- Use the YOLO-v4 with PyTorch framework to create the Deep Learning model, which is the "AI" part of the system.
- Deploy the Deep Learning model with the NVIDIA TensorRT framework 
- Use c++ to implement the tracker algorithm 

Sub tasks:

- Try ROS-2 and compare the performance

## Deep Learning

### Deploy with TensorRT

## Tracker with DeepSORT

## ROS

TODO List:

- Update this readme subsections
- Add the papers reference for yolo, deepsort and ?
- Add the AIGuy yt videos as references

WTF List:

- my cam is 30 fps but runs at 24 fps in ROS 1? Is this a ROS 1 bottleneck?
